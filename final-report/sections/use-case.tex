A gearbox is a mechanical device that increases the output torque of a motor or changes its speed. The shaft of the motor is connected to one end of the gearbox, which delivers a particular output torque and speed dictated by the gear ratio according to the internal gear design of the gearbox. \\
The physical components of gearboxes vary depending on the type of gearbox, as well as between manufacturers. The majority of gearboxes are made of steel, such as iron, aluminum, and brass. As a result, it is open and susceptible to wear and tear throughout its lifespan.\\

When the gearbox fails, it is because the gears are worn out.\\

Vibration condition monitoring can be utilized as a technique for early detection of a wide range of defects in mechanical parts. Using the same technique, we can predict failures in gearboxes. For this we have used a dataset which was derived using four vibration sensors placed in four different direction inside the gearbox subjected to variable load. The data was recorded in 2 gear conditions: healthy and broken tooth, each under variable load.\\

\subsection{Use-Case 1}

\textbf{Postcondition:} ‘Statistical Inferences’ page loads up properly or the user gets notified about the delay if any\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario:} ‘Statistical Inferences’ page loads up properly\\
\subsection{Use-Case 3}
\textbf{Title:} Starting ‘Gearbox Maintenance \& Failure Prediction’\\
\textbf{Description:} The application will inform the user if the gearbox needs maintenance.\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:} Client\\
\textbf{Precondition:} Client has triggered ‘Gearbox Maintenance \& Failure Prediction’\\
\textbf{Postcondition:} The user gets notified if the gearbox needs maintenance with a pop-up window.\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario:} The user gets notified if the gearbox is healthy / needs maintenance or has broken and needs replacement\\
\subsection{Use-Case 4}
\textbf{Title:} Pop-up window for notifying the client\\
\textbf{Description: }The application will inform the user about the maintenance status of the gearbox with a pop-up. \\
\textbf{Primary Actor:} \\
\textbf{Precondition: }Client has triggered ‘Gearbox Maintenance \& Failure Prediction’ using the Start button\\
\textbf{Postcondition: }The user gets notified with a pop-up window display the current status of the gearbox.\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario:} The user gets notified if the gearbox is healthy / needs maintenance or has broken and needs replacement\\
\subsection{Use-Case 5}
\textbf{Title:} Loading of ‘Historical Logs’ page\\
\textbf{Description:} The application should display timestamped logs to the user\\
\textbf{Primary Actor: }Database\\
\textbf{Precondition:} ‘Gearbox Maintenance \& Failure Prediction’ has already been triggered by the client at least once \\
\textbf{Postcondition:} The application should display relevant logs to the client \\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario:} Logs are displayed to the client \\
\subsection{Use-Case 6}
\textbf{Title: }Display of gearbox status using an GUI Indicator\\
\textbf{Description: }The application should display the gearbox status to the client with the help of a GUI Indicator\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:} -\\
\textbf{Precondition:} ‘Gearbox Maintenance \& Failure Prediction’ has already been triggered by the client at least once\\
\textbf{Postcondition:} The application should green for healthy gearbox, yellow for a gearbox which needs maintenance and red for a gearbox that has broken and needs replacement\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario: }The application displays the gearbox status to the client\\
