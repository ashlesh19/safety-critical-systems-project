\label{sec:safety}
The safety plan was created following a thorough examination of the system's hazard analysis results when it is subjected to specific environmental and technical conditions. We incorporated several safety mechanisms that were considered safety constraints within the system if the system failed, because a hazard describes a system’s state that should not occur for safety reasons.  We conducted a preliminary hazard analysis to identify probable hazards and their contributing flaws in a systematic manner. We then chose which flaws to fix and how to mitigate them after discussing with each other. The mitigations were outlined as mandatory safety measures for the system.\\

\subsection{Safety Requirement ID: 1}		
\textbf{Hazard Category:} Application is not accessible\\
\textbf{Hazard:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Application under maintenance.
	\item Application server down/crashed
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Root Cause:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Scheduled or planned maintenance
	\item Issues at the client side such as file system corruption
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Risks:} If the application is unavailable for a considerable amount of time, the data coming from vibration sensors will be lost thus resulting the low reliability. The user will not be able to actively see the status of the gearbox.\\
\textbf{Safety Plan:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Notify the user in prior about the downtime due to scheduled maintenance. Once the maintenance is over, the application shall publish the updated status of the gearbox using the data logged during downtime.
	\item While the system is inaccessible, the data coming from the vibration sensors will be directly persisted until it is used to update the threshold. The user will also be provided with certain troubleshooting tips in the user manual. Once the system is available again, the application shall publish the updated status of the gearbox using the data logged during downtime.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Safety Requirement ID: 2}		
\textbf{Hazard Category:} Incorrect threshold calculation\\
\textbf{Hazard:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Wrong data fetched to update threshold
	\item Faulty vibration sensor readings (Out of scope)
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Root Cause:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Improper transaction management of inconsistent data handling
	\item Wear and tear of vibration sensors
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Risks:} Inaccurate gearbox status predictions due to incorrect threshold updates\\
\textbf{Safety Plan:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Ensure data archival during downtime and orderly transaction execution to update the threshold
	\item Ensure regular maintenance checks of vibration sensors
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Safety Requirement ID: 3}		
\textbf{Hazard Category:} Coding or Programming bugs\\
\textbf{Hazard:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Unhandled Exceptions
	\item Sensor reading value formats
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Root Cause:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Code smells
	\item Conversion between different units of vibration
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Risks:} 
 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item Application crashes
 	\item Incorrect gearbox status predictions due to incorrect threshold updates
 \end{enumerate}
 
\textbf{Safety Plan:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Ensure proper coding guidelines is followed during development and testing
	\item Ensure conversion between different units of vibration is implemented during development phase.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Safety Requirement ID: 4}		
\textbf{Hazard Category:} Database errors \\
\textbf{Hazard:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Configuration file issues
	\item Poor performance due to low memory
	\item Server overload
	\item Connection failure
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Root Cause:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Improper database deployment
	\item Hardware issues or deadlocks arising due to improper transaction management
	\item Hardware issues or server crashes
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Risks:} Unavailability of the database might result in loss of data coming from the vibration sensors thus affecting the reliability of the system and incorrect predictions of gearbox status\\
\textbf{Safety Plan:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Ensure database is deployed properly
	\item Ensure orderly execution of optimized queries to avoid deadlocks and scheduled maintenance checks should be carried out to ensure proper functioning of the database
	\item Scheduled maintenance checks should be carried out to ensure proper functioning of the database
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Safety Requirement ID: 5}		
\textbf{Hazard Category:} Vibration sensor failure (Out of scope)\\
\textbf{Hazard:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Vibration sensor not working
	\item Faulty sensors
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Root Cause:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Wear and tear
	\item Sensor malfunction
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Risks:}  Data from one or more sensors will not be logged and thus will result in incorrect gearbox status prediction\\
\textbf{Safety Plan:}
User should be notified if the system is not receiving data from all 4 vibration sensors. The application should not predict gearbox status if at least 1 of the sensors are not working 

\subsection{Safety Requirement ID: 6}		
\textbf{Hazard Category:} Electrical failures (Out of scope)\\
\textbf{Hazard:} Circuit board damaged
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Sensor powerline damaged
	\item Circuit board damaged
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Root Cause:}
Wear and tear \\
\textbf{Risks:} Data from one or more sensors will not be logged and thus will result in incorrect gearbox status prediction\\
\textbf{Safety Plan:}
User should be notified if the system is not receiving data from all 4 vibration sensors. The application should not predict gearbox status if at least 1 of the sensors are not working.
